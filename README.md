# Ocean Pong

**Ocean Pong** is a browser-based pong game with an ocean theme, built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The game features an underwater environment with moving fish, bubbles, clouds, and a playable AI or multiplayer mode.

## Features
- Multiplayer and AI modes.
- Interactive ocean-themed background: fish, bubbles, clouds, sand, and sun.
- Dynamic paddle and ball mechanics with collision detection.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.
- Background music and sound effects.

## Development Process
During the development of **Ocean Pong**, I focused on:
- Structuring the game logic using JavaScript classes for `Paddle` and `Ball`.
- Animating the environment with moving bubbles and fish using `requestAnimationFrame`.
- Handling player input and AI movement for an interactive experience.
- Designing the UI for menu, popups, and in-game scoring using HTML and CSS.
- Debugging performance issues and refining gameplay mechanics.
- Implementing sound effects for paddle hits and background music.
